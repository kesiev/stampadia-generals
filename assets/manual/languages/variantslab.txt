# Welcome to the Variants Lab!

This manual collects some {config-title} **experimental game variants** you can play. Feel free to give it a shot and share your impressions. If a game mode listed here is fun enough it will be moved to the **Game Manual**!

A friendly voice echoes through the dungeon: **"Hold on! I'm coming!"**. A fellow {inhabitant} adventurer joined the battle!  
Will you be able to coordinate and defeat {enemy}?

This variant aims to allow 2 players to play {config-title} cooperatively, applying a few changes to the basic rules. This game mode is not suited for the game {version-lite} so **the game's {version-full} is required**.

During the game **Setup**, instead of drawing 5 {card-unit-plural}, each player draws 4 {card-unit-plural} to form their starting hand.

At the beginning of the **{phase-play}**, the players decide who the **First General** and the **Second General** is. The First General then performs a **single action** (Add a {unit} card from its hand to the battlefield, lose 1 health to draw a {unit} card, sacrifice 1 {unit}, or declare the {phase-play} end) and then passes the turn to the Second General. The two generals alternate turns until one of them declares the {phase-play} ends.

During the **{phase-recover}**, each player may draw up to 1 shield from the {shield-area}.

During the game, both generals **share the same {config-life} pool**. When a card effect or condition asks the player to draw or discard cards, the players may **split every single action of that effect or condition as they want**. That means that if an effect asks the player to discard 2 cards, both players may discard 1 card or one of them may discard 2 cards.

**{card-event-plural:capital}**. {card-event-plural:capital} can be still activated **anytime** by both players. The card effects and costs splitting rule applies to {card-event-plural} too.
